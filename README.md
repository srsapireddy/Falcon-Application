## Motivation and Significance
<br/>The motivation behind this project is to develop an idea where students are looking for ways to have high-configuration laptops with them to run 
any software. So, students can do coding on the web with minimum ram and hard disk of laptops or desktops. Students or customers decide which 
technology they want to use, irrespective of the system configuration they have.
<br/>	

## Software as a Service<br/>

This web application students of customers can create an entire application without installing the required software or the application within the 
systems. They can be able to deploy them with fewer issues onto the cloud.<br/>
The main aim of this project is to provide the students with a web interface where they can do coding on the web without the configuration overhead 
what is installing the required tools to run any software application.<br/>
